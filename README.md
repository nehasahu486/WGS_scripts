## Pipeline Execution Environment

#### The scripts developed and executed on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at the Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) and Norwich BioScience Institute (NBI)
Please note that these bash scripts (.sh file extensions) within the pipeline specify usage allocations tailored to the SLURM batch-queue environment at TSL and NBI.
These may require adjustments for different computing platforms.
